## Process for Merging a PR

1. Fork this repository

   ```sh
   Click the "Fork" button in the top right of the repo
   ```

1. Create a branch (use the project management tool ID and prefix with "feature/" or
   "bugfix/")

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/Clickkup-1234
   ```

1. Add an upstream to this main repository

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream [master repo]
   ```

1. In your terminal window, navigate into this repo using `cd`
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies to your repo
1. Once you have dependencies installed, you can proceed to run npm run dev to start an incredible fast local development server thanks to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
1. Make your changes including related tests and documentation

1. Make sure you lint, format and test your changes

   ```sh
   npm run lint
   npm run test -u
   ```

1. Push your changes to your fork's branch

   ```sh
   git fetch upstream master
   git merge upstream/master
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: commit message"
   git push origin name-of-your-branch
   ```

1. In GitHub, make a pull request (PR) to this repository that includes a filled
   description
1. Making a PR will automatically trigger a series of checks against your
   changes and generate a special PR link where you can view your changes (and
   share with others)
1. The team will reach out for more information or make suggestions
1. 🎉 Once the PR is good to go, they'll merge it in and you'll be credited as a
   contributor! Reach out to the team to follow their release cycle.
